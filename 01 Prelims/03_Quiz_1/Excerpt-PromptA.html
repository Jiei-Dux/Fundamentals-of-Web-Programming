        The death of Capitan Tiago and Basilio's imprisonment were soon reported in the province, and to the honor of the   <br>
        simple inhabitants of San Diego, let it be recorded that the latter was the incident more regretted and almost the  <br>
        only one discussed. As was to be expected, the report took on different forms, sad and startling details were given,<br>
        what could not be understood was explained, the gaps being filled by conjectures, which soon passed for             <br>
        accomplished facts, and the phantoms thus created terrified their own creators.                                     <br><br>

        In the town of Tiani it was reported that at least, at the very least, the young man was going to be deported and   <br>
        would very probably be murdered on the journey. The timorous and pessimistic were not satisfied with this but even  <br>
        talked about executions and courts-martial--January was a fatal month; in January the Cavite affair had occurred,   <br>
        and they even though curates, had been garroted, so a poor Basilio without protectors and friends--                 <br><br>

        "I told him so!" sighed the Justice of the Peace, as if he had at some time advised Basilio. "I told him so."       <br><br>

        "It was to be expected," commented Sister Penchang. "He would go into the church, and when he saw that the holy"    <br>
        water was somewhat dirty, he wouldn't cross himself with it. He talked about germs and disease, aba, it's the       <br>
        chastisement of God! he deserved it, and he got it! As though the holy water could transmit diseases! Quite the     <br>
        contrary, aba!                                                                                                      <br><br><br><br>
