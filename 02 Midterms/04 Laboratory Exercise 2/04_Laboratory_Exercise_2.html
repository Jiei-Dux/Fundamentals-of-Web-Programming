                    Anita Magsaysay-Ho was a Filipina painter who specialized in Social Realism 
                    and post-Cubism in regard to women in Filipino culture. Magsaysay-Ho's work 
                    appeals to Modernism by utilizing more abstract designs and styles rather 
                    than realistic approaches. She was the only female member of the "Thirteen 
                    Moderns," a standing group of Filipino modernist artists, and in 1958 was 
                    chosen by a panel of experts as one of the six major painters of the 
                    country's history. The most famous work of Magsaysay-Ho are subject to the 
                    beauty of Filipino women dealing with everyday issues. Collections of her 
                    artwork can be found in museums around the Philippines.
